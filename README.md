### Create your config file _(optional)_

Create a `config.js` file with data in the `utils` folder.
If no config is given, it will use default values that match with the french rules for standard contracts (25 days off per year).

```javascript
const config = {
  total: 25,
  taken: 0,
  startDate: new Date("06/01/2019")
};

export default config;
